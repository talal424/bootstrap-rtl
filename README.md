# bootstrap-rtl

a standalone CSS bootstrap v3.3.7 for RTL pages

I looked around and I didn't like adding alot of css files for rtl support

so I made changes to the source of original bootstrap files and made it fully RTL

no need for .pull-left or .pull-right

just code your page as its shown in the bootstrap homepage and it will be RTL

for example grid layouts in the past I had to use .pull-right for every colmun

that is not pretty if you missed one or two and you double check them everytime

# Usage:

just include bootstrap-rtl.min.css to your head and no need for the original
it is the original but it is RTL not LTR

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.rtl.min.css">
```
